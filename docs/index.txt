    Ursina makes it easier to develop games, visualizations and other kinds software.
    The concise API combined with the power of the Python programming language,
    makes life easier for the developer so they can focus on what they are making.

    Things you won't miss:

        * waiting for your code to compile
        * the editor crashing and possibly losing your work
        * not being able to fix engine bugs or add features
        * overly verbose code
        * uncustomizable workflow
        * waiting for imports
        * long build times
        * revenue cut or subscription fee

Examples

    Entity Example:

        # code
        from ursina import *            # import everything we need with one line.

        app = Ursina()
        ground = Entity(
            model = 'cube',
            color = color.magenta,
            z = -.1,
            y = -3,
            origin = (0, .5),
            scale = (50, 1, 10),
            collider = 'box'
            )

        app.run()                       # opens a window and starts the game.

How do I make a game?
# size 1, normal

    Ursina games are made by writing Python code. You can use any text editor you want.

        1) Create an empty .py file called 'ursina_game.py'
        2) Copy this text into your new file:

            # code
            from ursina import *

            app = Ursina()

            player = Entity(model='cube', color=color.orange, scale_y=2)

            def update():   # update gets automatically called.
                player.x += held_keys['d'] * .1
                player.x -= held_keys['a'] * .1

            app.run()   # opens a window and starts the game.

            # text


        3) Type this in the terminal to start the game. I recommend setting a hotkey
           for this in your text editor:

            # code
            python ursina_game.py
            # text

    The game should start! You can now move the orange box around with 'a' and 'd'!
    To close the window, you can by default, press shift+q or press the red x.
