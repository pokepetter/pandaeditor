    Entity Example:

        # code
        from ursina import *            # import everything we need with one line.

        app = Ursina()
        ground = Entity(
            model = 'cube',
            color = color.magenta,
            z = -.1,
            y = -3,
            origin = (0, .5),
            scale = (50, 1, 10),
            collider = 'box'
            )

        app.run()                       # opens a window and starts the game.

How do I make a game?
# size 1, normal

    Ursina games are made by writing Python code. You can use any text editor you want.

        1) Create an empty .py file called 'ursina_game.py'
        2) Copy this text into your new file:

            # code
            from ursina import *

            app = Ursina()

            player = Entity(model='cube', color=color.orange, scale_y=2)

            def update():   # update gets automatically called.
                player.x += held_keys['d'] * .1
                player.x -= held_keys['a'] * .1

            app.run()   # opens a window and starts the game.

            # text


        3) Type this in the terminal to start the game. I recommend setting a hotkey
           for this in your text editor:

            # code
            python ursina_game.py
            # text

    The game should start! You can now move the orange box around with 'a' and 'd'!
    To close the window, you can by default, press shift+q or press the red x.
